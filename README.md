# Personal website
This repo stores my personal website - [www.zakmarek.vercel.app](https://zakmarek.vercel.app/)

## Technologies used
- React
- Javascript

## Purpose of the project
I wanted to learn new technologies, React mainly for web development. Also to discover functionalities and make use of components. In the past I've worked in WordPress + Elementor, and making the website responsive was painful, having customizable components and responsiveness with Tailwind is a game changer for me.

## Deployment
I've deployed with Vercel because it was pretty straightforward, I also looked into deploying with AWS and Heroku, but I've come across different issues (mainly in running the web server, price for AWS EC2 / ECS) so I sticked to Vercel.
